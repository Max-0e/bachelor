				Agility plays a big role in managing the complexity of volatile and
				unpredictable environments, such as project management and project
				portfolio management, by focussing on the value created for the
				customer. This leads to the need of systematicaly scaling agile
				practices to enterprise level, which can be done by using i.e. the
				Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) or Flight Levels and results in big
				organizational structures with multiple levels of planning and decision
				making, which have to be documented.
				<br />
				<br />
				For effective decision making in those environments, decisions should be
				made with metrics in mind that are relevant for the Level in which the
				decision must be made. This work presents a customizable software
				solution to document the organizational structure in a way that allows
				automatic aggregation of such metrics to the level required. These
				Metrics should be presented in a meaningful manner, providing insights
				on progress from levels below the one where the decision must be made in
				and what implications the decision will have on the levels above. Focus
				of this work is the adaptability of the solution regardless of the
				framework used to scale agile practices.
				<br />
				<br />
				The solution was evaluated in a case study to determine its usefulness
				as a webbased software. The results show that tha adaptability of the
				solution is given, but to be useful in a real world scenario, the
				solution needs to be extended with time-based metrics like velocity,
				etc. and the ability to not only import data from operational tools like
				Jira, but also a synchronization of data between the tools, to make the
				solution usable over time, since the data only represents a snapshot of
				the current state of the organization.
