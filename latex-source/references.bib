  abstract  = {Much of current software engineering practice and research is done in a value-neutral setting, in which every requirement, use case, object, test case, and defect is equally important. However, most studies of the critical success factors distinguishing successful from failed software projects find that the primary critical success factors lie in the value domain. The value-based software engineering (VBSE) agenda discussed in this chapter and exemplified in the other chapters involves integrating value considerations into the full range of existing and emerging software engineering principles and practices. The chapter then summarizes the primary components of the agenda: value-based requirements engineering, architecting, design and development, verification and validation, planning and control, risk management, quality management, people management, and an underlying theory of VBSE. It concludes with a global road map for realizing the benefits of VBSE.},

  abstract = {Agile project management methods revolutionized the way how software projects are executed and organized. The question, however, on how to enable agility outside of individual projects and help larger organizations to compete with small entrepreneurial companies requires further attention. As a possible perspective, project portfolio management provides a global view on resources and their distribution across individual projects according to strategic choices. Based on 30 interviews conducted in 14 large European organizations this study contributes to the understanding of agile project management methods applied in IT project portfolios. First, we empirically identify the domains of practice. Then, guided by literature and our data we discuss the characteristics and implications of the agile portfolio management practice in our case organizations.}

  abstract = { Many researchers have suggested that meeting time, scope, and budget goals, sometimes called ‘project efficiency,’ is not the comprehensive measure of project success. Broader measures of success have been recommended; however, to date, nobody has determined empirically the relationship between efficiency and overall success or indeed shown whether efficiency is important at all to overall project success. Our aim in this article is to correct that omission. Through a survey of 1,386 projects we have shown that project efficiency correlates moderately strongly to overall project success (correlation of 0.6 and R2 of 0.36). Efficiency is shown through analysis to be neither the only aspect of project success nor an aspect of project success that can be ignored. }

  abstract = {Project management approaches are evolving to be more flexible and adaptive to meet the challenges associated with an increasingly complex and dynamic environment. However, potential changes in the underpinning logic supporting project decision making have scarcely been considered. We investigate the role of effectuation, a decision logic most commonly associated with entrepreneurship, as an alternative decision-making approach to the rational ‘causation’ logic that has traditionally underpinned project management processes. We develop and test a model to explore the portfolio- and project-level influences on the application of effectuation in project management. We find that portfolio governance mechanisms related to business case use and portfolio monitoring inhibit the use of effectuation, while project innovativeness is associated with increased use of effectuation. The paper contributes to research and practice by empirically investigating the antecedents to the use of effectuation decision-making logic in project and portfolio management through a multi-level model.}

Earlier research has suggested that single-project management may be related to project portfolio-level success, but empirical evidence has been scarce. A questionnaire survey with 279 firms verifies the hypothesized role of information availability, goal setting and systematic decision making in achieving portfolio management efficiency. The results reveal a mediating and direct role of project management efficiency but reject the hypothesized link between reaching project goals and portfolio management efficiency. The results imply that understanding of portfolio-level issues needs to be considered as part of project managers’ capabilities and not only a top management concern.}

A worldwide questionnaire with 242 responses was used, of which 136 high-performing responses were filtered out for quantitative analysis of best practices. Three portfolio control factors were identified: portfolio selection, portfolio reporting, and decision-making style. Two measures for portfolio management performance were identified: achievement of desired portfolio results and achievement of project and program purpose. The results indicate that different portfolio control mechanisms are associated with different performance measures. A contingency model was developed, including moderating effects by contextual variables. }
