    Agility plays a big role in managing the complexity of volatile and unpredictable environments, such as project management and project portfolio management, by focussing on the value created for the
    customer. This leads to the need of scaling agile practices to enterprise level, which can be done by using i.e. the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) or Flight Levels.
    \newline
    \newline
    For effective decision making in those environments, decisions should be made with metrics in mind that are relevant for the Level in which the decision must be made. This work presents an all in one customizable software solution to aggregate such metrics to the level required and present it in a meaningful manner, providing insights on progress fromÂ levels below the one where the decision must be made and what implications the decision will have on the levels above. Focus of this work is the adaptability of the solution regardless of the framework used to scale agile practices.
    \newline
    \newline
    The solution was evaluated in a case study to determine its usefulness of the software. The results show that tha adaptability of the solution is given, but to be useful in a real world scenario, the solution needs to be extended with time-based metrics like velocity, etc. and the ability to not only import data from operational tools like Jira, but also a synchronization of data between the tools, to make the solution usable over time, since the data only represents a snapshot of the current state of the, if the data is not updated regularly.
